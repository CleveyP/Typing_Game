In the beginning of time I was not born yet... I cannot begin to speculate on what was going on.
The meaning of adulthood is lost on me; I am a child-- not an adult.
In the meantime, why don't we go to Stockton or Concord or somewhere hot? I am too hot right here.
The heat will cool me the way a hot Indian Chai cools someone or in Russia, how they eat ice
cream to stay warm? That always puzzzled me. But I love the winter time in general. It is pale.
But right now I am hungry for the heat. I am hungry for the concrete and the busy shopping malls!
There is a dangerous hurricane brewing in the tropics (right by the angel island) roaming about.
